## Resource Clean-up

To prevent incurring unnecessary charges, it's important to clean up your Azure resources after completing your work with the application.

- **When to Clean Up:**
  - After you have finished testing or demonstrating the application.
  - If the application is no longer needed or you have transitioned to a different project or environment.
  - When you have completed development and are ready to decommission the application.

- **Deleting Resources:**  
  To delete all associated resources and shut down the application, execute the following command:
  
  ```bash
  azd down
  ```

  Please note that this process may take up to 20 minutes to complete.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Alternative:** You can delete the resource group directly from the Azure Portal to clean up resources.

## Troubleshooting

### Provisioning and Deployment Failures

- If you have an issue is with timeouts or provisioning resources, changing the location of your resource group can help, as there may be availability constrains for resources. Call `azd down` and remove your current resources, and delete the `.azure` folder from your workspace. Then, call `azd up` again and select a different region.

- You may debug further using [azd commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/reference#azd-deploy). `azd show` displays information abour your app and resources, and `azd deploy --debug` enables debugging and logging while deploying the application's code to Azure.
- Ensure that your az and azd tools are up to date.
- After fully deploying with azd, additional errors in the Azure Portal may indicate that your latest code has not been successfully deployed

### Azure Container Apps

- If your ACA does not boot up, it is possible that your deployment has failed. This could be due to quota constraints, permission issues, or resource availability. Check failures in the deployment and container app logs in the Azure Portal.

- Console traces in ACA can be found in the Azure Portal, but they may be unreliable. Use Python‚Äôs logging with INFO level, and adjust Azure HTTP logging to WARNING.
- Once your ACA is deployed, utilize the browser debugger (F12) and clear cache (CTRL+SHIFT+R). This can help debug the frontend for better traceability.

#### Azure API Management

- **Subscription Key Issues**: If you receive 401 errors, verify your subscription key is correct and included in the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header. You can find your subscription key in the Azure Portal under API Management ‚Üí Subscriptions.

- **Rate Limiting**: If you receive 429 errors, you've exceeded the rate limits (100/min or 1000/hour). Wait for the rate limit window to reset or contact your administrator to increase limits.

- **APIM Gateway Errors**: Check the APIM Analytics in Azure Portal for request logs and error details. Verify that the backend Container App is healthy by testing the direct Container App URL.

- **Subscription Management**: If you need additional subscriptions or different rate limits, navigate to the APIM Developer Portal or Azure Portal to manage subscriptions and products.

#### Azure AI Search

- **Search Service Not Available**: Verify that `USE_AZURE_AI_SEARCH_SERVICE=true` environment variable is set and that the search service has been deployed successfully. Check the deployment logs for any search service provisioning errors.

- **Index Not Found**: Ensure your search index has been created and populated. Check the search service in Azure Portal and verify the index exists with the expected schema.

- **Search Performance**: If search responses are slow, check the search service tier and consider upgrading from Basic to Standard for better performance. Monitor search service metrics in Azure Portal.

- **Vector Search Issues**: Verify that embeddings are being generated correctly and that the vector fields are properly configured in your search index schema.

#### Agents

- If your agent is occasionally unresponsive, your model may have reached its rate limit. You can increase its quota by adjusting the bicep configuration or by editing the model in the Azure AI Foundry page for your project's model deployments.

- If your agent is crashing, confirm that you are using a model that you have deployed to your project.
- This application is designed to serve multiple users on multiple browsers. This application uses cookies to ensure that the same thread is reused for conversations across multiple tabs in the same browser. If the browser is restarted, the old thread will continue to serve the user. However, if the application has a new agent after a server restart or a thread is deleted, a new thread will be created without requiring a browser refresh or signaling to the users. When users submit a message to the web server, the web server will create an agent, thread, and stream back a reply. The response contains `agent_id` and `thread_id` in cookies. As a result, each subsequent message sent to the web server will also contain these IDs. As long as the same agent is being used in the system and the thread can be retrieved in the cookie, the same thread will be used to serve the users.
- For document handling, use filename-based downloads to avoid storing files in dictionaries.
- Intermittent errors may arise when retrieving filenames for file IDs, which may be mitigated by using a single worker and fresh threads for each new agent.
- File citation can be enhanced by automatically including filenames to reduce manual steps.
